# Churn_Rate_Prediction
The project uses user data from KKBOX to predict subscriber churn accurately using machine learning. This project tries to address the major concern of the streaming industry- Attrition! Goal is to enhance Customer Engagement & Revenue, and reduced Customer Attrition. 

### The criteria of "churn" is no new valid service subscription within 30 days after the current membership expires.

The dataset used in the project is Kaggle Challenge dataset where WSDM has challenged the Kaggle ML community to help solve these problems and build a better music recommendation system.

Different data mining techniques are used to prepare the data, where extracted data is cleaned, preprcessed, and prepared for model building. Different machine learning algorithms are used like SVM, Logistic Regression, and ensemble models like Random Forest, XGBoost. The most optimal performance is achived by Random Forest Classifier.
